Assignment :


MOBILE PROGRAMMING TRACK
Goal: The purpose of this try out is to determine if our applicants understand about basic component of mobile application
Story: Annabelle is a police officer and has some informant she wants to keep outside of her contacts app in her mobile device. She decide to make a new app that is simply a static app which loads her private contacts but she got no time so she asks you to do so

Requirements:
The app just loads a static array of objects from json file. The List should only display the full name (first name and last name) and the organization the contact related to.
When the contact is clicked, she will be shown with the detail of the contact which are: name, organization, phone number, and the address
She can go back to the lists as she want.
The appearance of the app should be simple and informative
The app can be built with ReactNative or Native Android

Nice to Have:
She can add new contact.
Instead of static json files, internal storage would be a better place to save and load the contact list.
